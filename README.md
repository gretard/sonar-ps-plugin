- **sonar.ps.tokenizer.skip** - if set to true - skips tokenizer, which might be time consuming, defaults to *false*
- **sonar.ps.file.suffixes** - allows to specify which files should be detected as Powershell files, defaults to *.ps1,.psm1,.psd1*
- **sonar.ps.executable** - allows to specify powershell executable, defaults to *powershell.exe* (since version 0.3.0)
- **sonar.ps.plugin.skip** - if set to true - skips plugin in general, meaning that no sensors are run, defaults to *false* (since version 0.3.0)
